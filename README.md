# **Quicbot**

_Quicbot_ is a Python and Flask-based tool/chatbot designed to minimize your research time on Google. It fetches the top 10 results from the most visited sites, providing a quick overview of the information you're seeking. 

### Key Features:

- **Categorized Searches**: Choose from a set of predefined categories with relevant options tailored to your needs.
- **Custom Prompts**: Not finding what you need? No problemâ€”enter your own prompt, and Quicbot will handle the rest.

### Additional Features:

For developers and tech enthusiasts, Quicbot includes a **Website Cloning Tool**. Yes, you heard that right! It can clone any websiteâ€”just paste the URL in the designated box, and Quicbot will take care of the rest.

**_Someone:_** Where would it store the cloned sites?

**_Me:_** It will be saved in the directory where you cloned Quicbot. Alternatively, you can check your CMD or terminal for the exact path.

### How to Run Quicbot

It's simple! Follow these steps in your CMD or terminal (Python required):

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

And that's itâ€”you're all set!

**Note:** This project is still under development, collaboratively coded by both myself and ChatGPT.
